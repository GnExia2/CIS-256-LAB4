|Garrick Ngai, Winston Tsia, Nicole Mills-Dunning |

Objective
In this lab assignment, you will build upon your understanding of linked lists in Java. The content of our linked list will build on our class from Lab 3. You will have a Product class with fields like productID, productName, productRating, and price, and instead of storing it in an array you will store it within a doubly linked list and perform sorting operations on it. 

Learning Outcomes
By completing this assignment, you will:

Gain hands-on experience with linked lists.
Understand how to sort a linked list using different algorithms.
Requirements
Your program should accomplish the following:

Implement a doubly linked list with basic operations (insertion, deletion, traversal).
Your node class should have two constructors, one default with just data parameter and one with references to previous and next nodes
Implement two sorting methods to sort the elements of your linked list:
Insertion sort
Merge sort
